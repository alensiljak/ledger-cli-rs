# Incubator
The idea hub for Ledger-cli-compatible Rust port

See the description at the main [organization's page](https://github.com/ledger-rs/).

# Details

The Open Questions category contains the issues that require group collaboration and some sort of agreement before the decision is made and real work should follow. The idea is to measure three times and cut once, as the saying goes. The general idea in regards to the decisions is similar to the [RFC process](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/) that Rust organization is using. The point behind is to encourage community feedback on ideas and proposals.

Once again - welcome to the project. This is a place where we all act civil and respect others' points of view. Hope this project provides value to all the involved.

# Workflow

The workflow proposal is outlined in https://github.com/ledger-rs/ledger-cli-rs/discussions/24.
