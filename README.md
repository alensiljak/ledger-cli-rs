# ledger-cli-rs
Ledger-cli (PTA) port to Rust

# Introduction

Hi and welcome to the Ledger-rs project!

This repository is a collaboration point for a potential [Ledger](https://ledger-cli.org/)-compatible port to Rust.

This is a very early stage in the project initiation. You will notice that the Discussions area is mostly used in this repository. It is intended for interested individuals to collaborate on defining all aspects of the project.
The Wiki section contains some static references and is useful as a notepad for now.

The initial idea was to create a Ledger-compatible implementation in Rust. Due to Rust's rising popularity, it might be a good time to gather people who might want to learn and use Rust and, at the same time, breathe some new wind into Ledger-cli, providing new features, fixing existing issues, etc.

# Discussions

Please use the Discussions area to raise any issues you would like to get addressed. If the existing categories do not match, they can be rearranged to better suit our needs.

The Open Questions category contains the issues that require group collaboration and some sort of agreement before the decision is made and real work should follow. The idea is to measure three times and cut once, similar to Rust's RFC process.

The general idea in regards to the decisions is similar to the [RFC process](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/) that Rust organization is using.

Once again - welcome to the project. This is a place where we all act civil and respect others' points of view. Hope this project provides value to all the involved.
